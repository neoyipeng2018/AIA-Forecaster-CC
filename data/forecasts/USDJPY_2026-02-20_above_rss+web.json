            "reasoning": "USD/JPY has been bid into the mid-150s as hawkish Fed signals (FOMC minutes) and the prospect of a higher-for-longer U.S. policy path widen the rate differential, supporting USD strength and sustaining carry into USD assets. A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

However, a second, countervailing medium-term theme persists: markets still price eventual BoJ normalization. If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155. Overall bias: near-term bullish for USD/JPY (pair higher) but conditional medium-term bearish for USD/JPY (yen appreciation) if BoJ hiking expectations firm and Fed cuts are priced in.",

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

            "reasoning": "USD/JPY has been driven higher in the near term by a hawkish tilt in recent FOMC minutes and a softer-than-expected Japan CPI print that eases immediate pressure on the BoJ. That combination widens the US-Japan yield gap and supports USD funding flows and carry into USD/JPY, which helped the pair test the 155 area. Short-run momentum is therefore USD-bullish. However, a second, countervailing medium-term theme persists: markets still price eventual BoJ normalization. If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155. Overall bias: near-term bullish for USD/JPY (pair higher) but conditional medium-term bearish for USD/JPY (yen appreciation) if BoJ hiking expectations firm and Fed cuts are priced in.",

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155.

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

That combination widens the US-Japan yield gap and supports USD funding flows and carry into USD/JPY, which helped the pair test the 155 area. Short-run momentum is therefore USD-bullish. However, a second, countervailing medium-term theme persists: markets still price eventual BoJ normalization. If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155. Overall bias: near-term bullish for USD/JPY (pair higher) but conditional medium-term bearish for USD/JPY (yen appreciation) if BoJ hiking expectations firm and Fed cuts are priced in.",

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155.

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

That combination widens the US-Japan yield gap and supports USD funding flows and carry into USD/JPY, which helped the pair test the 155 area. Short-run momentum is therefore USD-bullish. However, a second, countervailing medium-term theme persists: markets still price eventual BoJ normalization. If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155. Overall bias: near-term bullish for USD/JPY (pair higher) but conditional medium-term bearish for USD/JPY (yen appreciation) if BoJ hiking expectations firm and Fed cuts are priced in.",

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155.

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

That combination widens the US-Japan yield gap and supports USD funding flows and carry into USD/JPY, which helped the pair test the 155 area. Short-run momentum is therefore USD-bullish. However, a second, countervailing medium-term theme persists: markets still price eventual BoJ normalization. If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155. Overall bias: near-term bullish for USD/JPY (pair higher) but conditional medium-term bearish for USD/JPY (yen appreciation) if BoJ hiking expectations firm and Fed cuts are priced in.",

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155.

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

That combination widens the US-Japan yield gap and supports USD funding flows and carry into USD/JPY, which helped the pair test the 155 area. Short-run momentum is therefore USD-bullish. However, a second, countervailing medium-term theme persists: markets still price eventual BoJ normalization. If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155. Overall bias: near-term bullish for USD/JPY (pair higher) but conditional medium-term bearish for USD/JPY (yen appreciation) if BoJ hiking expectations firm and Fed cuts are priced in.",

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

That combination widens the US-Japan yield gap and supports USD funding flows and carry into USD/JPY, which helped the pair test the 155 area. Short-run momentum is therefore USD-bullish. However, a second, countervailing medium-term theme persists: markets still price eventual BoJ normalization. If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155. Overall bias: near-term bullish for USD/JPY (pair higher) but conditional medium-term bearish for USD/JPY (yen appreciation) if BoJ hiking expectations firm and Fed cuts are priced in.",

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155.

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

That combination widens the US-Japan yield gap and supports USD funding flows and carry into USD/JPY, which helped the pair test the 155 area. Short-run momentum is therefore USD-bullish. However, a second, countervailing medium-term theme persists: markets still price eventual BoJ normalization. If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155. Overall bias: near-term bullish for USD/JPY (pair higher) but conditional medium-term bearish for USD/JPY (yen appreciation) if BoJ hiking expectations firm and Fed cuts are priced in.",

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

            "reasoning": "USD/JPY has been driven higher in the near term by a hawkish tilt in recent FOMC minutes and a softer-than-expected Japan CPI print that eases immediate pressure on the BoJ. That combination widens the US-Japan yield gap and supports USD funding flows and carry into USD/JPY, which helped the pair test the 155 area. Short-run momentum is therefore USD-bullish. However, a second, countervailing medium-term theme persists: markets still price eventual BoJ normalization. If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155. Overall bias: near-term bullish for USD/JPY (pair higher) but conditional medium-term bearish for USD/JPY (yen appreciation) if BoJ hiking expectations firm and Fed cuts are priced in.",

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

That combination widens the US-Japan yield gap and supports USD funding flows and carry into USD/JPY, which helped the pair test the 155 area. Short-run momentum is therefore USD-bullish. However, a second, countervailing medium-term theme persists: markets still price eventual BoJ normalization. If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155. Overall bias: near-term bullish for USD/JPY (pair higher) but conditional medium-term bearish for USD/JPY (yen appreciation) if BoJ hiking expectations firm and Fed cuts are priced in.",

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

That combination widens the US-Japan yield gap and supports USD funding flows and carry into USD/JPY, which helped the pair test the 155 area. Short-run momentum is therefore USD-bullish. However, a second, countervailing medium-term theme persists: markets still price eventual BoJ normalization. If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155. Overall bias: near-term bullish for USD/JPY (pair higher) but conditional medium-term bearish for USD/JPY (yen appreciation) if BoJ hiking expectations firm and Fed cuts are priced in.",

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse.

That combination widens the US-Japan yield gap and supports USD funding flows and carry into USD/JPY, which helped the pair test the 155 area. Short-run momentum is therefore USD-bullish. However, a second, countervailing medium-term theme persists: markets still price eventual BoJ normalization. If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155. Overall bias: near-term bullish for USD/JPY (pair higher) but conditional medium-term bearish for USD/JPY (yen appreciation) if BoJ hiking expectations firm and Fed cuts are priced in.",

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

            "reasoning": "USD/JPY has been driven higher in the near term by a hawkish tilt in recent FOMC minutes and a softer-than-expected Japan CPI print that eases immediate pressure on the BoJ. That combination widens the US-Japan yield gap and supports USD funding flows and carry into USD/JPY, which helped the pair test the 155 area. Short-run momentum is therefore USD-bullish. However, a second, countervailing medium-term theme persists: markets still price eventual BoJ normalization. If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155. Overall bias: near-term bullish for USD/JPY (pair higher) but conditional medium-term bearish for USD/JPY (yen appreciation) if BoJ hiking expectations firm and Fed cuts are priced in.",

            "reasoning": "USD/JPY has been bid into the mid-150s as hawkish Fed signals (FOMC minutes) and the prospect of a higher-for-longer U.S. policy path widen the rate differential, supporting USD strength and sustaining carry into USD assets. A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155.

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

            "reasoning": "USD/JPY has been driven higher in the near term by a hawkish tilt in recent FOMC minutes and a softer-than-expected Japan CPI print that eases immediate pressure on the BoJ. That combination widens the US-Japan yield gap and supports USD funding flows and carry into USD/JPY, which helped the pair test the 155 area. Short-run momentum is therefore USD-bullish. However, a second, countervailing medium-term theme persists: markets still price eventual BoJ normalization. If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155. Overall bias: near-term bullish for USD/JPY (pair higher) but conditional medium-term bearish for USD/JPY (yen appreciation) if BoJ hiking expectations firm and Fed cuts are priced in.",

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

            "reasoning": "USD/JPY has been driven higher in the near term by a hawkish tilt in recent FOMC minutes and a softer-than-expected Japan CPI print that eases immediate pressure on the BoJ. That combination widens the US-Japan yield gap and supports USD funding flows and carry into USD/JPY, which helped the pair test the 155 area. Short-run momentum is therefore USD-bullish. However, a second, countervailing medium-term theme persists: markets still price eventual BoJ normalization. If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155. Overall bias: near-term bullish for USD/JPY (pair higher) but conditional medium-term bearish for USD/JPY (yen appreciation) if BoJ hiking expectations firm and Fed cuts are priced in.",

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155.

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

That combination widens the US-Japan yield gap and supports USD funding flows and carry into USD/JPY, which helped the pair test the 155 area. Short-run momentum is therefore USD-bullish. However, a second, countervailing medium-term theme persists: markets still price eventual BoJ normalization. If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155. Overall bias: near-term bullish for USD/JPY (pair higher) but conditional medium-term bearish for USD/JPY (yen appreciation) if BoJ hiking expectations firm and Fed cuts are priced in.",

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155.

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

That combination widens the US-Japan yield gap and supports USD funding flows and carry into USD/JPY, which helped the pair test the 155 area. Short-run momentum is therefore USD-bullish. However, a second, countervailing medium-term theme persists: markets still price eventual BoJ normalization. If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155. Overall bias: near-term bullish for USD/JPY (pair higher) but conditional medium-term bearish for USD/JPY (yen appreciation) if BoJ hiking expectations firm and Fed cuts are priced in.",

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155.

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

That combination widens the US-Japan yield gap and supports USD funding flows and carry into USD/JPY, which helped the pair test the 155 area. Short-run momentum is therefore USD-bullish. However, a second, countervailing medium-term theme persists: markets still price eventual BoJ normalization. If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155. Overall bias: near-term bullish for USD/JPY (pair higher) but conditional medium-term bearish for USD/JPY (yen appreciation) if BoJ hiking expectations firm and Fed cuts are priced in.",

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

That combination widens the US-Japan yield gap and supports USD funding flows and carry into USD/JPY, which helped the pair test the 155 area. Short-run momentum is therefore USD-bullish. However, a second, countervailing medium-term theme persists: markets still price eventual BoJ normalization. If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155. Overall bias: near-term bullish for USD/JPY (pair higher) but conditional medium-term bearish for USD/JPY (yen appreciation) if BoJ hiking expectations firm and Fed cuts are priced in.",

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

However, a second, countervailing medium-term theme persists: markets still price eventual BoJ normalization. If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155. Overall bias: near-term bullish for USD/JPY (pair higher) but conditional medium-term bearish for USD/JPY (yen appreciation) if BoJ hiking expectations firm and Fed cuts are priced in.",

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

That combination widens the US-Japan yield gap and supports USD funding flows and carry into USD/JPY, which helped the pair test the 155 area. Short-run momentum is therefore USD-bullish. However, a second, countervailing medium-term theme persists: markets still price eventual BoJ normalization. If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155. Overall bias: near-term bullish for USD/JPY (pair higher) but conditional medium-term bearish for USD/JPY (yen appreciation) if BoJ hiking expectations firm and Fed cuts are priced in.",

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

            "reasoning": "USD/JPY has been driven higher in the near term by a hawkish tilt in recent FOMC minutes and a softer-than-expected Japan CPI print that eases immediate pressure on the BoJ. That combination widens the US-Japan yield gap and supports USD funding flows and carry into USD/JPY, which helped the pair test the 155 area. Short-run momentum is therefore USD-bullish. However, a second, countervailing medium-term theme persists: markets still price eventual BoJ normalization. If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155. Overall bias: near-term bullish for USD/JPY (pair higher) but conditional medium-term bearish for USD/JPY (yen appreciation) if BoJ hiking expectations firm and Fed cuts are priced in.",

A softer-than-expected Japan CPI reading removes immediate pressure on the BoJ to tighten, reinforcing near-term JPY weakness and contributing to the pair’s recent gains. Near-term momentum is therefore tilted toward further USD/JPY upside, with technical congestion around 155 a key level for near-term pause or consolidation.\n\nThat said, medium-term risks lean the other way. Markets are still pricing eventual BoJ normalization and any clear acceleration in BoJ tightening expectations would narrow the policy gap and could trigger rapid yen appreciation via carry unwind and portfolio rebalancing. Equally, US macro surprises (Core PCE, GDP) can swing Fed-cut expectations and flip the directional impulse. Net: near-term directional bias is bullish USD/JPY, but the trade has elevated two-way risk — medium-term the balance is neutral-to-bearish on USD as positioning and BoJ repricing present a credible path for JPY strength.",

That combination widens the US-Japan yield gap and supports USD funding flows and carry into USD/JPY, which helped the pair test the 155 area. Short-run momentum is therefore USD-bullish. However, a second, countervailing medium-term theme persists: markets still price eventual BoJ normalization. If and when the BoJ moves decisively to tighten while the Fed shifts to cuts, the yield gap would narrow and portfolio/carry flows could reverse, creating a sizable yen-revaluation that would be bearish for USD/JPY. Key near-term catalysts to watch are the US PCE print (which can materially change Fed cut expectations), subsequent FOMC communication, fresh Japan CPI prints/BoJ commentary, and technical behaviour around 155. Overall bias: near-term bullish for USD/JPY (pair higher) but conditional medium-term bearish for USD/JPY (yen appreciation) if BoJ hiking expectations firm and Fed cuts are priced in.",
