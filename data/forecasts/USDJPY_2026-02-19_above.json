            "reasoning": "Near term USDJPY is being pulled in two directions. On the upside for USDJPY, hawkish FOMC minutes and Fed officials’ reluctance to cut are widening the US–Japan yield gap and supporting USD demand via carry and portfolio flows; that dynamic is reinforced by recent capital outflows from Japanese equities. These factors give the dollar an immediate edge. Offsetting this, stronger-than-expected Japanese machinery orders and clearer BoJ signalling have revived market bets on BoJ normalization, which would narrow the yield gap and strengthen JPY if sustained. Geopolitical risk episodes (US–Iran) add intermittent JPY safe‑haven support, while mixed domestic growth prints (weak GDP) limit a one‑way JPY rally.\n\nOverall directional bias: modestly bullish USD vs JPY in the near term (USDJPY higher) driven by Fed hawkishness and portfolio outflows, but the position is vulnerable — a sustained run of strong Japanese data or clear BoJ tightening communication would flip the bias. Key catalysts to watch: Fed staff/minutes and US data that keep rate expectations elevated, follow‑through in Japanese capex/inflation data, monthly foreign investor flows, and any escalation of geopolitical risk that pushes markets into safe‑haven mode.",

            "reasoning": "Near term USDJPY is being pulled in two directions. On the upside for USDJPY, hawkish FOMC minutes and Fed officials’ reluctance to cut are widening the US–Japan yield gap and supporting USD demand via carry and portfolio flows; that dynamic is reinforced by recent capital outflows from Japanese equities. These factors give the dollar an immediate edge. Offsetting this, stronger-than-expected Japanese machinery orders and clearer BoJ signalling have revived market bets on BoJ normalization, which would narrow the yield gap and strengthen JPY if sustained. Geopolitical risk episodes (US–Iran) add intermittent JPY safe‑haven support, while mixed domestic growth prints (weak GDP) limit a one‑way JPY rally.\n\nOverall directional bias: modestly bullish USD vs JPY in the near term (USDJPY higher) driven by Fed hawkishness and portfolio outflows, but the position is vulnerable — a sustained run of strong Japanese data or clear BoJ tightening communication would flip the bias. Key catalysts to watch: Fed staff/minutes and US data that keep rate expectations elevated, follow‑through in Japanese capex/inflation data, monthly foreign investor flows, and any escalation of geopolitical risk that pushes markets into safe‑haven mode.",

            "reasoning": "Near term USDJPY is being pulled in two directions. On the upside for USDJPY, hawkish FOMC minutes and Fed officials’ reluctance to cut are widening the US–Japan yield gap and supporting USD demand via carry and portfolio flows; that dynamic is reinforced by recent capital outflows from Japanese equities. These factors give the dollar an immediate edge. Offsetting this, stronger-than-expected Japanese machinery orders and clearer BoJ signalling have revived market bets on BoJ normalization, which would narrow the yield gap and strengthen JPY if sustained. Geopolitical risk episodes (US–Iran) add intermittent JPY safe‑haven support, while mixed domestic growth prints (weak GDP) limit a one‑way JPY rally.\n\nOverall directional bias: modestly bullish USD vs JPY in the near term (USDJPY higher) driven by Fed hawkishness and portfolio outflows, but the position is vulnerable — a sustained run of strong Japanese data or clear BoJ tightening communication would flip the bias. Key catalysts to watch: Fed staff/minutes and US data that keep rate expectations elevated, follow‑through in Japanese capex/inflation data, monthly foreign investor flows, and any escalation of geopolitical risk that pushes markets into safe‑haven mode.",

On the upside for USDJPY, hawkish FOMC minutes and Fed officials’ reluctance to cut are widening the US–Japan yield gap and supporting USD demand via carry and portfolio flows; that dynamic is reinforced by recent capital outflows from Japanese equities. These factors give the dollar an immediate edge. Offsetting this, stronger-than-expected Japanese machinery orders and clearer BoJ signalling have revived market bets on BoJ normalization, which would narrow the yield gap and strengthen JPY if sustained. Geopolitical risk episodes (US–Iran) add intermittent JPY safe‑haven support, while mixed domestic growth prints (weak GDP) limit a one‑way JPY rally.\n\nOverall directional bias: modestly bullish USD vs JPY in the near term (USDJPY higher) driven by Fed hawkishness and portfolio outflows, but the position is vulnerable — a sustained run of strong Japanese data or clear BoJ tightening communication would flip the bias. Key catalysts to watch: Fed staff/minutes and US data that keep rate expectations elevated, follow‑through in Japanese capex/inflation data, monthly foreign investor flows, and any escalation of geopolitical risk that pushes markets into safe‑haven mode.",

            "reasoning": "Near term USDJPY is being pulled in two directions. On the upside for USDJPY, hawkish FOMC minutes and Fed officials’ reluctance to cut are widening the US–Japan yield gap and supporting USD demand via carry and portfolio flows; that dynamic is reinforced by recent capital outflows from Japanese equities. These factors give the dollar an immediate edge. Offsetting this, stronger-than-expected Japanese machinery orders and clearer BoJ signalling have revived market bets on BoJ normalization, which would narrow the yield gap and strengthen JPY if sustained. Geopolitical risk episodes (US–Iran) add intermittent JPY safe‑haven support, while mixed domestic growth prints (weak GDP) limit a one‑way JPY rally.\n\nOverall directional bias: modestly bullish USD vs JPY in the near term (USDJPY higher) driven by Fed hawkishness and portfolio outflows, but the position is vulnerable — a sustained run of strong Japanese data or clear BoJ tightening communication would flip the bias. Key catalysts to watch: Fed staff/minutes and US data that keep rate expectations elevated, follow‑through in Japanese capex/inflation data, monthly foreign investor flows, and any escalation of geopolitical risk that pushes markets into safe‑haven mode.",

            "reasoning": "Near term USDJPY is being pulled in two directions. On the upside for USDJPY, hawkish FOMC minutes and Fed officials’ reluctance to cut are widening the US–Japan yield gap and supporting USD demand via carry and portfolio flows; that dynamic is reinforced by recent capital outflows from Japanese equities. These factors give the dollar an immediate edge. Offsetting this, stronger-than-expected Japanese machinery orders and clearer BoJ signalling have revived market bets on BoJ normalization, which would narrow the yield gap and strengthen JPY if sustained. Geopolitical risk episodes (US–Iran) add intermittent JPY safe‑haven support, while mixed domestic growth prints (weak GDP) limit a one‑way JPY rally.\n\nOverall directional bias: modestly bullish USD vs JPY in the near term (USDJPY higher) driven by Fed hawkishness and portfolio outflows, but the position is vulnerable — a sustained run of strong Japanese data or clear BoJ tightening communication would flip the bias. Key catalysts to watch: Fed staff/minutes and US data that keep rate expectations elevated, follow‑through in Japanese capex/inflation data, monthly foreign investor flows, and any escalation of geopolitical risk that pushes markets into safe‑haven mode.",

On the upside for USDJPY, hawkish FOMC minutes and Fed officials’ reluctance to cut are widening the US–Japan yield gap and supporting USD demand via carry and portfolio flows; that dynamic is reinforced by recent capital outflows from Japanese equities. These factors give the dollar an immediate edge. Offsetting this, stronger-than-expected Japanese machinery orders and clearer BoJ signalling have revived market bets on BoJ normalization, which would narrow the yield gap and strengthen JPY if sustained. Geopolitical risk episodes (US–Iran) add intermittent JPY safe‑haven support, while mixed domestic growth prints (weak GDP) limit a one‑way JPY rally.\n\nOverall directional bias: modestly bullish USD vs JPY in the near term (USDJPY higher) driven by Fed hawkishness and portfolio outflows, but the position is vulnerable — a sustained run of strong Japanese data or clear BoJ tightening communication would flip the bias. Key catalysts to watch: Fed staff/minutes and US data that keep rate expectations elevated, follow‑through in Japanese capex/inflation data, monthly foreign investor flows, and any escalation of geopolitical risk that pushes markets into safe‑haven mode.",

            "reasoning": "Near term USDJPY is being pulled in two directions. On the upside for USDJPY, hawkish FOMC minutes and Fed officials’ reluctance to cut are widening the US–Japan yield gap and supporting USD demand via carry and portfolio flows; that dynamic is reinforced by recent capital outflows from Japanese equities. These factors give the dollar an immediate edge. Offsetting this, stronger-than-expected Japanese machinery orders and clearer BoJ signalling have revived market bets on BoJ normalization, which would narrow the yield gap and strengthen JPY if sustained. Geopolitical risk episodes (US–Iran) add intermittent JPY safe‑haven support, while mixed domestic growth prints (weak GDP) limit a one‑way JPY rally.\n\nOverall directional bias: modestly bullish USD vs JPY in the near term (USDJPY higher) driven by Fed hawkishness and portfolio outflows, but the position is vulnerable — a sustained run of strong Japanese data or clear BoJ tightening communication would flip the bias. Key catalysts to watch: Fed staff/minutes and US data that keep rate expectations elevated, follow‑through in Japanese capex/inflation data, monthly foreign investor flows, and any escalation of geopolitical risk that pushes markets into safe‑haven mode.",

            "reasoning": "Near term USDJPY is being pulled in two directions. On the upside for USDJPY, hawkish FOMC minutes and Fed officials’ reluctance to cut are widening the US–Japan yield gap and supporting USD demand via carry and portfolio flows; that dynamic is reinforced by recent capital outflows from Japanese equities. These factors give the dollar an immediate edge. Offsetting this, stronger-than-expected Japanese machinery orders and clearer BoJ signalling have revived market bets on BoJ normalization, which would narrow the yield gap and strengthen JPY if sustained. Geopolitical risk episodes (US–Iran) add intermittent JPY safe‑haven support, while mixed domestic growth prints (weak GDP) limit a one‑way JPY rally.\n\nOverall directional bias: modestly bullish USD vs JPY in the near term (USDJPY higher) driven by Fed hawkishness and portfolio outflows, but the position is vulnerable — a sustained run of strong Japanese data or clear BoJ tightening communication would flip the bias. Key catalysts to watch: Fed staff/minutes and US data that keep rate expectations elevated, follow‑through in Japanese capex/inflation data, monthly foreign investor flows, and any escalation of geopolitical risk that pushes markets into safe‑haven mode.",

            "reasoning": "Near term USDJPY is being pulled in two directions. On the upside for USDJPY, hawkish FOMC minutes and Fed officials’ reluctance to cut are widening the US–Japan yield gap and supporting USD demand via carry and portfolio flows; that dynamic is reinforced by recent capital outflows from Japanese equities. These factors give the dollar an immediate edge. Offsetting this, stronger-than-expected Japanese machinery orders and clearer BoJ signalling have revived market bets on BoJ normalization, which would narrow the yield gap and strengthen JPY if sustained. Geopolitical risk episodes (US–Iran) add intermittent JPY safe‑haven support, while mixed domestic growth prints (weak GDP) limit a one‑way JPY rally.\n\nOverall directional bias: modestly bullish USD vs JPY in the near term (USDJPY higher) driven by Fed hawkishness and portfolio outflows, but the position is vulnerable — a sustained run of strong Japanese data or clear BoJ tightening communication would flip the bias. Key catalysts to watch: Fed staff/minutes and US data that keep rate expectations elevated, follow‑through in Japanese capex/inflation data, monthly foreign investor flows, and any escalation of geopolitical risk that pushes markets into safe‑haven mode.",
